From the original description on gitorious:

Compile-time integer sequences.

Implementation of my C++ standard proposal, N3658
(http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2013/n3658.html), which
will be part of the C++14 standard.

Requires a good C++11 compiler such as G++ 4.7

Clang 3.3 mostly works but gives the wrong result when using xxx_seq_for.
